          <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do I find courts near me?</h3>
            <p>
              Open the app and allow location access. The app will automatically
              show basketball courts near your current location.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq">
            <h3>What does "Hot Now" mean?</h3>
            <p>
              "Hot Now" shows courts where players are currently checked in.
              This helps you find active games happening right now.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do check-ins work?</h3>
            <p>
              When you arrive at a court, tap the "I'm Here" button to check in.
              This lets other players know you're there. Check-ins automatically
              expire after 3 hours.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do I upload photos of a court?</h3>
            <p>
              On a court's detail page, tap the "Add Photo" button. You can take
              a photo or choose one from your library.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do I save my favorite courts?</h3>
            <p>
              On a court's detail page, tap the star icon to save it. View all
              your saved courts by tapping the "Saved" filter on the main
              screen.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq">
            <h3>Can I add a new court?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes! Tap "Submit a Court" from the Profile tab to add a basketball
              court to our database.

          <div class="faq">
            <h3>The app says I need to enable location services</h3>
            <p>
              pickup. needs location access to show courts near you. Go to your
              device Settings → pickup. → Location, and select "While Using the
              App".
            </p>

          <div class="faq">
            <h3>How do I delete my data?</h3>
            <p>
              pickup. uses anonymous IDs, so there's no personal account to
              delete. Check-ins automatically expire after 3 hours. To delete
              photos you've uploaded, tap the photo and select "Delete". To
              remove all app data, simply uninstall the app.
